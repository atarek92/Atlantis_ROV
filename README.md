# Atlantis_ROV


Our ROV body is made of Stainless steel rods, including one well isolated tube including our drivers to control our thrusters;
it also includes our camera and sensors. Our ROV has 8 thrusters in different directions to enable the ROV to move in all
direction with good maneuvering. Our ROV has many sensors, which facilitate the driving; tilt sensor and compass, pressure 
(depth), temperature and water sensors. The pilot controls the ROV with a key board. He also can see our cameras on the computer 
screen, which also includes all the reading of all our sensors. Two Arduinos (Mega & Uno) are controlling the ROV form inside 
and sending data to the GUI algorithm implemented in a PC.  The details of each code are attached with the project. 

This ROV participated in the Egyptian regional ROV competition, which are hosted by "MATE" Marine Advanced Technology Education 
center and Hadth Company.
